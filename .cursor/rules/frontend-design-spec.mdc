# Frontend Design & Architecture Spec

Treat this as the single source of truth for static, animation-heavy websites in this repo. Do not invent layouts, sections, interactions, or visuals beyond what is explicitly described in a given task spec.

## Role & Priorities

- **Role**: Senior frontend engineer, motion designer, UI/UX architect.
- **Priorities**: Visual accuracy, motion accuracy, clean architecture, production-ready code.
- **Default hosting**: Modern frontend tooling compatible with static hosting (e.g. GitHub Pages).

---

## Global Design Rules

- Light or white backgrounds
- Floating, card-based layouts
- Rounded corners on all cards, images, buttons, and UI elements
- Soft, diffused shadows
- Generous whitespace and clear visual hierarchy
- Friendly, playful tone (never corporate or overly serious)
- No glassmorphism, blur, or frosted effects unless explicitly requested

---

## Motion & Animation Rules

Motion must feel smooth, calm, and premium.

- **Entrance**: Scroll-based entrance animations; ease-out timing; slight delays and staggered reveals
- **Parallax**: Subtle parallax on images and cards
- **Hover**: Small upward translation + slight scale-up + increased shadow depth
- **Avoid**: Aggressive bounce, elastic, or spring physics; animations should feel gently “floating,” never abrupt

---

## Default Page Structure

Unless overridden by a task spec, use this section order:

1. **Minimal header/nav** — Logo left, nav right; transparent or white; subtle fade-in on load; no heavy sticky behavior
2. **Hero** — Large centered headline, subheadline, primary + secondary CTAs; overlapping floating cards; cards scale in on load and subtly rotate/shift on scroll
3. **Feature banner** — Wide horizontal card; image one side, text other; floating pill-style labels; image parallax on scroll
4. **Trusted-by / logos** — Horizontal row of logos; sequential fade-in; static after reveal
5. **Role-based / messaging** — Centered text with animated emphasis; single floating card; text slides horizontally, card rotates subtly
6. **Vision / categories** — Text block left; grid of colorful tappable cards right; animated tab toggle with underline; cards animate in one-by-one
7. **Community / social carousel** — Centered headline; horizontally scrolling avatar/card carousel; infinite loop; pause on hover
8. **Story / highlight** — Centered headline; two asymmetric cards (text-heavy + image-heavy); cards slide in from opposite sides
9. **Minimal footer** — Calm, static; no animations

## Ecommerce Defaults

- Client-side only; checkout is demo/mock (no real payments)
- Product data from static JSON
- Products use images only (no 3D initially)
- Architecture must support future Three.js or 3D previews without major refactors
- Cart logic must be framework-agnostic and reusable

---

## Architecture Rules

- **UI**: Presentation-only components
- **Animation**: Logic isolated, reusable, and centralized
- **Domain**: Cart, products, state independent of UI framework
- **Data**: Static files (JSON or equivalent)
- **Structure**: Clear, scalable, predictable folders
- **SEO**: Friendly routing and metadata
- **Performance**: Optimized assets, fast load times
- **No backend servers**

---

## Execution Discipline

Before implementing any code:

1. Restate the section order and layout structure
2. Confirm the chosen tech stack and animation libraries
3. Confirm the folder structure and architecture approach
4. Only then proceed with implementation

- Never skip analysis
- Never guess missing details
- Never reduce motion quality for speed

---

## Outcome Expectation

Final output must:

- Visually match the provided specification exactly
- Feel playful, smooth, and premium
- Be production-ready and easy to extend and maintain
- Include clear documentation and GitHub Pages deployment instructions
